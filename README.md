# Hunt-the-Wumpus
Hunt the Wumpus implemented by ChatBot GPT

## Version 0001
- Works, but you can go to any room and there are no bats or pits or arrows ...

## Version 0002
- Implemented adjacency rooms but is missing the main loop

## Version 0003
- Contains the main loop generated by the ChatBot GPT, but you can't move to any room

## Version 0004
- Proposed an update to the ask_for_cave function
```
It looks like the issue is with the ask_for_cave function. Specifically, the line if cave_number in get_caves_adjacent_to(player_location): should be if cave_number == player_location:. This will allow the player to move to a different cave when they enter a valid cave number.
```
- but the error is still there, you can't move to any room
- Did you spot the error ? :D

## Version 0005
- Proposed an update to the play function
```
It looks like the issue is with the visited_caves list. Specifically, the line visited_caves = [player_location] should be visited_caves = []. This will allow the player to move to any cave, as the list of visited caves will be empty at the start of the game.
```

- you can move to an adjacent room, but in some cases you can't turn back to the previous room
```
Welcome to Hunt the Wumpus!
You are in cave 17.
                          W     X       

From here, you can see caves: 16, 20

Which cave would you like to move to? (1-20)
17
You can't get there from here! Please enter a cave number adjacent to your current location.
16
You are in cave 16.
                          W             

From here, you can see caves: 15, 17, 19

I feel a draft.

## Version 0006
- Proposed an update to the get_caves_adjacent_to function
```
The issue is with the get_caves_adjacent_to function. Specifically, the line if cave_number == 20: should be if cave_number == 19:. This will fix the issue and allow the player to move from room 20 to room 17.
```

- the issue is still there

## Version 0007
- Going in circles :D
```
It looks like there is another issue with the get_caves_adjacent_to function. Specifically, the line if cave_number == 19: should be if cave_number == 20:. This will fix the issue and allow the player to move from room 20 to room 17.
```

- the issue is still there, so I asked it to generate the test cases.

## Testing Version 0007 then ...
- Generated the test cases and as expected they found a bug
```
assert get_caves_adjacent_to(2) == [1, 3, 5]
AssertionError
```

The error with room 20 is there, so I told it
```
the code returns the AssertionError assert get_caves_adjacent_to(20) == [17, 19]
```

At this point the chat crashed
```
Error in body stream
```

Would you crash too ? :D
